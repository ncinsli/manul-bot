# About
This is a telegram bot for a local chat where people count manuls. It keeps people away from counting mistakes as it counts manuls with people.
This bot isn't capable of handling russian language cases.

# How it works
- Use **/init i** (i âˆŠ N) for setting start point in counting. This is useful as you can add this bot later, after your chat members have already counted for a lot.
- Use **/stat** for statistics 
- Get warning messages when you counted incorrectly
- Use **/help** for a little reference
